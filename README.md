A description on how JS will be incorporated in your website or on one of the webpages.  It must clearly state where it will be used or found on the website.

Home page:

We will use js to incorporate an animation for how the page will load in. How the animation will work is that the main page will start of blank and after a few seconds a football will fly in, hit the center and the page will crack, showing the reflections of each character. Then the outer borders will fade in as well as the text being typed in.

Lineup:

Js will be used by adding a button for each profile of each player and when the user presses each profile then they will be zoomed in, showing more detailed information of each player.

Matches:

Js will be incorporated in the same way with each matchup of each round being a button that the user can press showing a detailed description of the match.

Teams:

This page will be similar to the lineup page in the sense that the logos of each team will be a button that the user can press in order to view a more detailed description of team and its players.
